about-contents:
  - title: Local Mapping
    text: Our vision is the whole planet mapped, frequently updated by residents as the world changes. Local communities and organizations drive the creation of data and acquire the capacity to use it for decision-making and local development.
  - title: Community Focused
    text: "The Week promotes local data collection, in communities, by communities, for communities. This is a survey activity, not a remote imagery digitization exercise. Any kind of data is good: infrastructure, services, businesses, green and public spaces, socioeconomic conditions, and cultural activities."
  - title: Open Tools
    text: Local information backed by detailed global imagery and integrated into maps makes data real, present and contextualized. Data becomes fluid and sharable.
  - title: Learning Globally
    text: Use maps and local information to showcase your place, share your work, ask questions and find solutions collaboratively, across the globe.
