about-contents:
  - title: Local Mapping
    text: Our vision is the whole world mapped, frequently updated by residents themselves as the world changes. Communities have equal access to creation of data, and capacity to use for decision making.
  - title: Community Focused
    text: Data about communities, is best collected by that community. The Week promotes community data collection, in communities, by communities. This is a survey activity, not a remote imagery digitization activity. Any kind of data is fine, whether infrastructure, demographic, or other.
  - title: Open Tools
    text: Data is which backed or integrated by detailed global imagery or vector data makes data real, present and contextualized. Rather than siloâ€™d, data becomes fluid.
