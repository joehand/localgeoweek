The impressive GDP growth rate in India over the last decade has made way for an ever growing poverty gap. With urban population expanding at an explosive rate, it has become difficult for the cities to cope with the sudden influx of the poor populous. Slums have popped up overnight and the lack of planning at city level for informal settlements has made it very difficult for these people to access basic facilities such as sanitation, water, and electricity. This is a matter of social justice that has been neglected in our country since decades.

When I returned to India after completing my masters in urban planning from London, I noticed the immense gap in the delivery of basic services in slums, from sanitation to proper ventilation, electricity, and water. When city planning was taken up, the poor were simply forgotten. I realised that architecture was highly elitist catering only to a certain sect of society. Very few people were diligently working in the field of housing for the poor or access to infrastructure. We started Shelter Associates in 1993 and as architects, helped local governments map informal settlements in the city. Consequently along with housing we started working on improving and uplifting local sanitation conditions.

One of the major stumbling blocks in our early years we found was lack of comprehensive and detailed information. Even the government did not have accurate data that reflected on ground realities. We knew that to make meaningful interventions we would need to get to get on the ground and collect primary data ourselves.

In 2000, we started with mapping poverty—which includes mapping all physical structures and infrastructure, collecting socio-economic information like income, education, occupations, etc. —by surveying slums. We have built our database by visiting every house in the slums to curate data on whether they have a toilet. After having our database in place, it was much easier to know where to begin. Then using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as a tool for integrating information about slums for inclusive urban planning and development, we brought all data onto one platform for quick access. Using this system, the user knows the details about the individual settlement and the socio-economic condition of the area and each of the members living there. However, realising that GIS mapping alone was not effective, we decided to superimpose our data on existing DP provided by the urban local bodies. But with the launch of Google Earth in 2005, we used the more sophisticated web based tool to get satellite images and combine it with ground data to keep track of slum growth.

The images of Yamunagar slum, Pune below show how we use maps and data to precisely target the most vulnerable families. The data shows exactly which households own toilets and which use community toilets/practice open defecation. Based on the data we planned our intervention strategies to make a swift and effective intervention. The maps pinpointed vulnerabilities in the existing infrastructure as well as the sizes of houses in the settlement.

Satellite imagery was a powerful tool that strengthened results derived from our micro-level planning. Google has given us a grant to use Google Earth Pro—an advanced version of Google Earth.  We use this tool to digitise slum boundaries and attach factsheets containing data that has been compiled to register key information about households and the site characteristics. All the information is available on the screen with the click of a mouse! Google Earth also offered to provide technical support to explore how best SA could use the interface between GIS platform and Google Earth.  Digital maps certainly provide speedy access, analysis and management of spatially referenced information.

Along with planning our interventions we also use GIS-Google Earth maps to measure our impact. These become powerful tools when we offer our consultation to the local governing bodies, communities, and other partnering organisations. The image below showing the before and after image of Rajeev Gandhi slum has helped us explain our successes to sceptic community members.

The information we collected became a powerful tool.  We not only put together robust project at planning level and conceived a model which can be scaled upward to achieve greater impact but also made the information available to others on an open source platform to conduct interventions in their respective fields. The data we have gathered is available on our website and local governments of the cities we have worked in have linked their website to ours to guide users to the data.
