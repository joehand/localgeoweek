**By Luis Bettencourt, Cities Project: Santa Fe Institute.**

Mapping is an ideal way to understand a neighborhood, how people live, its streets, its services, its houses and public spaces. A great map allows you not only to immerse yourself in space but also to imagine how it could change for the better. You can do this with a good traditional map, but it would be even better in 3D.

Most maps show neighborhoods from the top. New GIS tools in phones or other small devices are making a big difference helping communities and city governments understand urban spaces and needed improvements, such as physical accesses or sanitation. We are interested in the power of maps to facilitate positive change for cities and their residents in ever better and more powerful ways.

To this end, our group -- <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/research/cities-scaling-and-sustainability/">the Cities Project at the Santa Fe Institute</a> -- has been collaborating with slum-dweller communities to enable better mapping of informal neighborhoods.

We are now experimenting with easy ways to create maps in 3 dimensions. Such maps show not only where streets, buildings and services are in space, they create an immersive model that can be used to identify and communicate problems much more effectively and propose solutions.

It sounds difficult to imagine how such detailed maps could be built quickly and without too much effort. Amazingly, there is a very simple solution: the technical word is photogrammetry. In practice, this means that we need photos – lots of them – the rest is easy.

Hollywood and Google use photogrammetry extensively. We think it would be more interesting and more important to use it to help create a better quality of life for real people in real neighborhoods, especially in slums.

We have started to explore the power of photogrammetry by trying it out on our own buildings at the Santa Fe Institute.

The video shows how it works. In practice, one needs many different photographs from the place to be mapped, from different angles. This can be done with a flying camera – the video shows footage from a small toy drone – but can also just use photos taken by a community from the ground, rooftops, etc. It’s a good school project, for example.

Once photos are created, there is software that identifies points of overlap between images, maps them to GIS coordinates in space, and reconstructs an entire 3D shape. This shape is referenced to space so it creates a map, as well as a 3D model of each building, service (garbage dump, lamp post,tree) as well as a mesh, an image that retains colors, textures, etc.

The resulting map, 3D shape and texture can all be modified to imagine how a neighborhood can be transformed. For example, how a street plan can be changed to provide services, how buildings may be made taller, plastered or painted in different colors. These maps can also be printed in 3D and provide communities with physical models of a neighborhood to better analyze its present situation and imagine its possible changes: a sort of Lego kit for urban planning.

We are excited about the potential of creating community-led 3D maps of neighborhoods, including informal settlements.

Being able to map an informal settlement in 3D has many potential benefits that we are excited to explore:

* It generates a high precision map, appropriate for cadastral mapping and the provision of services.
* It provides an immersive experience for residents to show the issues they face to others.
* It maps details of structures, including temporary ones, and helps document how neighborhoods change over time in great detail.
* It can help promote neighborhood resilience by generating quick maps at times of distress, such as during floods or after fires, when reconstruction or improved drainage becomes especially needed.

<div class="caption">A video showing the construction of a 3D model of the main building at the Santa Fe Institute. Photos of the building, taken from many angles, are meshed together and turned into a 3D model. This model creates a map, a 3D shape and a texture. The 3D model can be used as a high-precision map of building locations and shapes. Applied to neighborhoods, this information can help communicate community challenges to others, assist with creating urban resilience in the face of emergencies, and allow new forms of community-led urban planning solutions.</div>
