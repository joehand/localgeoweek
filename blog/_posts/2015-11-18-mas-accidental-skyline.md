Too often, New Yorkers are caught off guard by new development in their neighborhoods. <a href="http://www.mas.org/urbanplanning/accidental-skyline/">The Municipal Art Society's Accidental Skyline interactive maps</a> offer tools to help demystify the city planning process and bring the public into the conversation.

MAS embarked on its Accidental Skyline initiative in 2013 in response to the super-tall towers rising along the southern border of Central Park. For the most part, these buildings are being built as-of-right, without public or environmental review. When completed, they will cast new shadows on the park and change views of the city. While MAS’s work started in response to the buildings near Central Park, the issue is one that increasingly concerns neighborhoods across the city. Many New Yorkers feel left out of the planning process and are unaware of development proposals until shovels hit the ground.

The maps show where new development could occur across New York City – allowing New Yorkers to assess how their neighborhoods could be impacted. These maps help users visualize the invisible — available air rights in New York City, the purchase and sale of which allow buildings to become taller and bigger than the city zoning code would otherwise allow.

We have four main goals in this work:

1. Ensure robust civic engagement as the city develops and grows.

2. Bring greater transparency to the city’s planning process.

3. Highlight the impacts of development on NYC neighborhoods, including parks, open space, infrastructure and the skyline.

4. Secure policy and regulatory changes that protect the city’s vital open spaces and create a better balance between benefits received by private developers and impact on the public realm.


The maps were created in CartoDB using tax lot information from the New York Department of City Planning MapPLUTO data. To arrive at available air rights, the maximum floor area ration (FAR) for a site was calculated, from which the built FAR was subtracted. The maps display the remaining air rights as both FAR and square footage, as well as additional information like current zoning, lot size and a Google Streetview of the property.

The project was featured in CityLab, Curbed NY, Architizer, and the Commercial Observer, and was named one of Planetizen’s top 10 websites of 2014.
