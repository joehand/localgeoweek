Slums, like any other neighborhood require accesses in and out of places of residence and work.

Often though, such accesses are so narrow that slum upgrading requires very fine knowledge of the spatial layout of accesses and houses. The lack of appropriate street accesses underlies most of the greatest problems of slums – from obtaining an address to providing sanitation or emergency assistance.

The <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/research/cities-scaling-and-sustainability/">Santa Fe Institute Cities Project</a> is working with slum-dweller communities to understand these issues and to create better maps of the land uses in theses settlements. The picture below shows an analysis of path width in Mankhurd Phule Nagar, an informal settlement in Mumbai, India. The original map was developed by community members in collaboration with <a href="http://www.sparcindia.org/">SPARC</a> and the Mumbai Railway Corporation. Our group has digitized the map, which in turn has allowed us to analyze the fine structure of widths of various paths and public spaces, shown in different colors.

Path widths less than 1m make it impossible to provide sanitation and several meters are necessary for an emergency vehicle such as an ambulance or fire truck to enter and exit the settlement. It is easy to see that most existing paths in Mankhurd Phule Nagar are much narrower than required for even sanitation access.  The few paths that are wide enough (some in the center of the settlement) are disconnected from each other and the outside road system.

How can we solve the problem of access in dense informal settlements?

Our team is developing new methods and tools in collaboration with slum–dweller communities, to identify minimally disruptive ways to create accesses to all structures in a neighborhood.

This work shows that it is always possible to gently evolve an informal settlement to provide modern services without eviction and extensive demolition, though some local adjustments to buildings and paths will be needed.

We are working to create a well-designed set of tools to analyze maps and propose such solutions.
