Open Data Kit (ODK) is a set of tools that help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. By starting with a questionnaire in [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org), users can collect, manage, and analyze data with a large ecosystem of tools.

The suite of tools included with ODK are [ODK Collect](https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/), [ODK Aggregate](https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/), and [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org).

Other tools, such as Enketo and the Ona platform, are also built using the ODK standard.
