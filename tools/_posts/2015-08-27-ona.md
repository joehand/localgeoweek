Ona is a platform for managing forms, projects, and user-submitted data across large organizations. Data can be uploaded directly or collected via an XLSForm-compatible service (such as Enketo or ODK Collect).

Ona makes it easy for organizations to organize forms, project, and share data with groups of users. They also provide tools to allow users to map, analyze, and report data in real-time.
