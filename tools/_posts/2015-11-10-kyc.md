Know Your City is global campaign to collect and consolidate city-wide data on slum/informal settlements by residents of these settlements as the basis for inclusive development between the urban poor and local governments. This emerges from the historical practice within SDI to create processes by which slum dwellers themselves collect data about their everyday lives and the spaces they reside in. The data SDI federations have been collecting for the past three decades has become the basis of a unique social and political argument that is at the heart of SDIâ€™s mission to develop and support an informed and united voice of the urban poor.
