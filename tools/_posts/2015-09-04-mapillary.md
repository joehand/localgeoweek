Mapillary is a passionate community of people who capture, share and explore street level photos. Anyone can join the community and collect photos by using simple tools like smartphones or action cameras.

By connecting photos across time and users, we can create a immerse street level photo view for people to virtually explore different places in world. It could be a walk on a beach in Costa Rica, the streets of Tokyo or a drive through the Swedish countryside.

We simply want to empower you to decide which streets, roads and hidden paths should be mapped, and when. There is no longer a need to wait for someone else to take street level photos for you.

For private and non-commercial use Mapillary will always be free.
